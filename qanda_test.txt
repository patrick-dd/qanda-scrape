NoneTONY JONES: Good evening and welcome to Q&amp;A.; I'm Tony Jones broadcasting live from the Brisbane Powerhouse. Answering your questions tonight: the Opposition Spokesman on Regional Development and Water Senator Barnaby Joyce; the state director of Queensland One Nation Ian Nelson; Cape York businesswoman Gina Castelain; National president of the ALP and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh; and the newly appointed climate commissioner Tim Flannery. Please welcome our panel.Okay. Q&amp;A; is live from 9.35 Eastern Daylight Savings Time. We're simulcasting live across Australia on ABC News 24 and across the region on the Australia Network. You can go to your - our website, I should say to send your questions live and join the Twitter conversation using the hash tag that's on your screen right now.Well, as we go to air tonight a thunder storm is raging over Brisbane but it's the political storm over refugees and multiculturalism that's leading the political agenda. Our first question tonight comes from Oliver Squires.OLIVER SQUIRES: Well, thanks, Tony. Barnaby Joyce, do you agree with Scott Morrison when he says that the asylum seekers from Christmas Island shouldn't have been able to attend the funerals of their family members or do you agree with Joe Hockey when he says he would never take away anyones right to say goodbye to their loved ones?BARNABY JOYCE: Yeah, well, what we've got there is a misquote of what Scott said. He didn't say that they shouldn't attend the funeral. What he did say was that we should check the costs and I think that is a fair statement. We're looking at about 14 and a half thousand dollars per person and I suppose the first question that could be asked is could we have done it cheaper and if you can do it cheaper and still bring the outcome, then that's a fair question to ask. With Joe...TONY JONES: How would you do it cheaper, by the way, just out of interest?BARNABY JOYCE: Well, I suppose you could take them on a commercial flight, Tony, as opposed to - as opposed to an RAF flight. There's a whole range of things that we could be looking at as to how we make sure that we don't spend all your money. We've got to try and make sure than in a nature that's in excess of $181 billion in debt that we try to make sure every penny counts. TONY JONES: This is your quote from last week. The price of compassion is not limitless.BARNABY JOYCE: That's correct and if...TONY JONES: What's it mean actually.BARNABY JOYCE: Well, it means, Tony, that you can't just say, well, I have an unlimited chequebook. That there is no end to the price I'm prepared to pay to bring about a certain outcome. You just can't do it. We are not dealing with my money, Tony, or your money. We are dealing with the taxpayers' money and we have some sort of responsibility there and people might spin that in any way, shape or form that they like, but we do have a job and the moment we relinquish that job we should give up being in parliament.TONY JONES: Okay. Anna Bligh, you watched the whole, I think rather unseemly episode over the drowned asylum seekers last week. Would you agree that neither side of politics came out of this very well?ANNA BLIGH: Well, I'd probably use the word you did. I think it is unseemly to be debating the cost of funerals when children are attending the funerals of their parents as, you know, some of these people were. Look, these are not easy questions but ultimately I felt when I saw the footage of these people dying on our televisions, being smashed up against cliffs in terrible seas, reaching for their children, knowing that they couldn't get there, I felt sick and I felt that none of us, as Australians, came out of it very well and I look forward to hearing some of the outcomes of the reviews that are going into the whole issue.TONY JONES: How did you feel when the young orphan boy was bouncing across from one side of the country to the other and back, not knowing where he was going to end up?ANNA BLIGH: Well, it's hard not to think that we couldn't do better.TONY JONES: Barnaby Joyce, I'll just come back to you just for a moment, because you said you were going to go to Senate Estimates and try and uncover the cost of these funerals. That's still the plan, is it?BARNABY JOYCE: I think that, you know, that is the forum, Tony, as you know. The forum for asking questions about what happens to your money in any side of politics comes from a Senate Estimates and there is an expectation that people have a right to say, well, look, I want these questions asked. It's not a question of compassion. It's not a question of whether you believe it's right or wrong. It's a question that you're dealing with other people's money and they have a right to know how you're dealing with it, because you've got to pay it back, at the end of the day. TONY JONES: Okay. Judging from their website, One Nation has been doing your homework for you. I'm wondering have you been getting their emails, like many others have?BARNABY JOYCE: No. No, this is a very interesting thing. No, I don't. I know Ian and I was talking to him outside but I don't get their emails. I'm not on their mailing list but, you know, sometimes I get a sense that now I do get a bit worried, Tony, that now we're going to sort of launch ourselves into trying to create a pariah out of One Nation. That, you know, we can't persecute these people, as you certainly shouldn't so we are going to persecute these ones instead and I think that's wrong.TONY JONES: Who is persecuting them?BARNABY JOYCE: Well, this idea that any person who even says hello to somebody from One Nation is somehow a form of pariah and I think that's wrong.TONY JONES: Ian Nelson, do you feel like a pariah?IAN NELSON: No, certainly not. TONY JONES: Well, okay. Let's move on then. I presume that you back Scott Morrison - going back to the original question, I presume that you back Scott Morrison's original stand on the funerals?IAN NELSON: Well, yes. We have always said that you've got to start counting your dollars, very simply. Look, God forbid - this is tragic but God forbid if something happened to your family member or one of our family members, I don't think we'd put it on the government to get the whole family to travel to wherever the funeral is and then pay for the funeral and then fly them back.TONY JONES: Unless they were, perhaps, imprisoned in detention.IAN NELSON: Well, that's a valid point but I'll repeat this one more time. If the Labor Party - the Labor Government had stuck to the Pacific Solution, that boat would never have been there and those tragic people would never have been dead.TONY JONES: Were you surprised - just briefly, were you surprised to hear Scott Morrison so clearly echoing the views that you put out on this subject on your website?IAN NELSON: Not at all. I mean we're conservatives, the same as the Liberal National Party are. I mean at the moment we're blogging daily because we need to be more relevant and we're finding that the Liberal National Party are...AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Indistinct)(AUDIENCE LAUGH)IAN NELSON: ...the National party are people with the same likeminded views.TONY JONES: And picking up your views and running them as policy?IAN NELSON: You said that, not me.TONY JONES: It's a question.IAN NELSON: Well, they might. They might. And we're happy about that, the same as when political parties use our policies. We're happy about that. We're not here to govern Australia. We're here to keep politics honest.TONY JONES: Okay. Let's go to our second question of the night, because it does - we'll bring in the other panellists after that but it's on the same subject and it comes from John Macnaughton.JOHN MACNAUGHTON: What action can the average Australian or Queenslander do to stop the drift towards Multiculturalism? The boatpeople seem to have more rights in Australia than the people who were born here.TONY JONES: Gina, can I get you to comment on that. I'm going to bring in the rest of the panel on this but that's a view that's out there. What do you say?GINA CASTELAIN: Well, first of all I'd just like to say my father was a boat person and actually my people have been - my people have been dealing with boat people for over 400 years now. TONY JONES: Ian Nelson, I'll pick you up on that question.IAN NELSON: Well, I think what the gentleman meant was we have legislation in force in Australia that basically looks after ethnics very, very well and we could be discriminated against at any time. We can be discriminated at any time if we seem to have offended someone and, you know, we don't agree with that. Our women, why do they have to cover themselves up on a certain day to go swimming? It's so...TONY JONES: I don't actually - your women, when you say "your women" who do you mean?IAN NELSON: Well, Australians. Australians. Australian...TONY JONES: So they should swim naked?IAN NELSON: Well, no. Well, that would be nice but no, no, not at all, Tony. What I'm saying is now we have a call by the Muslims to insist that our women be properly covered - appropriately covered when they go swimming. Wearing a burka? I don't get it.TONY JONES: Anna Bligh, I've got to bring you in here. I mean, have you heard the call for all women to wear burkas on the beach? I haven't heard that one.ANNA BLIGH: I haven't heard it but I'm not in the naked swimming camp either so...TONY JONES: Where do you sit on this question? It's a serious question that's been asked there.ANNA BLIGH: Well, no, I think it's an interesting question. It implies that there is some drift towards multiculturalism. I turned 50 last year, so I've been around in Australia for a little while and, you know, the Australia I grew up in had people from all different nations in my neighbourhood and throughout the 1970s as I was becoming a young adult, many people arrived from Vietnam and I don't recall it being so difficult to accept and then we had waves of people from China, for example, after Tiananmen Square. I don't see a drift happening now that wasn't happening in the 1980s and the 1970s and the 1960s. I see the Australia - the modern Australia that I'm part of looks - you know, it looks as multicultural to me as it did - there's more people but the mix - sure, some of them are coming from different countries but, you know, I love it. I love the fact that there's - look at this. Look at these people here. TONY JONES: Yeah, just quickly on this, the other part of what the gentleman said, boat people seem to have more rights in Australia than people who were born here. Are you disturbed that kind of idea has taken route?ANNA BLIGH: Look, I think it's very unfortunate that people would think that. Australians enjoy, I think, some of the best human rights in the world and we're very lucky. We have, you know, unfettered right to practice our own religion, to vote, to get health care. You know, wherever you look when you look around the world, it's pretty hard to think of a place that you'd rather be than be an Australian when it comes to exercising rights and if I was living in a detention centre, I don't think I'd think that I was somehow better off than your average Australian.TONY JONES: Let me just go to Tim Flannery on this. I know you're here to talk about global warming primarily, but this issue is raising temperatures. No question about that.TIM FLANNERY: I think people just fail to see that this has been a multicultural country from the very start. The first fleet had Greek pirates among it. It had black people from the West Indies. The very first festival celebrated in this country on any scale was the Festival of Allah in 1806 in Sydney, a Muslim Festival. So we have been multicultural from the very beginning. We're going to continue that way. It is just in the fabric of this country.TONY JONES: Barnaby Joyce. BARNABY JOYCE: Tony, I think you set the gentleman up a bit. I think that in a way you got a question and made the most out of it and good luck to you. But I think that most people...TONY JONES: Sorry, do you think it's not legitimate for him to ask that question because I'm intrigued by that possibility.BARNABY JOYCE: I think it then turned into putting a person in a place where quite obviously they're going to get chopped to pieces and I think that was the game. But...TONY JONES: Well, perhaps you could just answer the question.BARNABY JOYCE: Well, obviously we're all ethnic at one stage, weren't we? I mean, every person who is in this nation at some stage, except for Gina's mother or father came from somewhere else and so we have to respect that. The first forebears of mine came here because their parents starved to death in a hedge. In my family there are approximately 10 languages spoken if we all turn up for Christmas dinner, so I've got no problems with living in a society with many cultures, but I always want people to make sure that first and foremost, as Sir James Gobbo said, when he was initially bringing up this issue, that we focus on making Australia a great place and we talk about the things that the premier talked about: the equality of the sexes, equality of religions, a free and fair go, and that supplants and stands in front of any other associations we might have after that.TONY JONES: And just briefly on the other part of that question, boat people seem to have more rights in Australian than people who are born here. Is that something you agree with?BARNABY JOYCE: No, I don't. I think that when you arrive in a new country it's tough going and it's a hard road to hoe because you have to try and make your way in an area where probably a language that's spoken is not your first language. I don't believe that it is a ticket to Vanity Fair to arrive here as a refugee.TONY JONES: Okay, we've got another question on a similar subject. It comes from Yehya El Kholed.YEHYA EL KHOLED: My question is to all parties. How do they expect Muslims to integrate and be proud of being Australians when our politicians are debating how many Muslims can immigrate to Australia and what they should wear and how they should socialise?TONY JONES: Okay. Let's here from, first of all, Anna Bligh on that. Did you hear the question correctly?ANNA BLIGH: I did and I think any Australian government is always going to want to have a debate about how many people can be brought into the country in any particular year. I don't think that that's necessarily a bad discussion about how many people we want, how big we want Australia to be and how many we can accommodated in any one particular year or two year period. But I think it's a - we have to be very careful in having that discussion to make sure that it is about how many can we accommodated rather than what kind of people, if you like. But I think it's also very important that - and taking Barnaby's point, that we understand that when people come to this country from other cultures, from other religions, from other languages, that we are tolerant of that and we put in place some assistance to help people, you know, become part of Australian community in a meaningful way and, you know, that's not easy but I think if you look at how Australia has managed it overall, you know, I think we have to be actually proud of the success. It's not without its problems. It's not without these kind of debates. It's not, you know, a bed or roses all the time but when I look at other countries who are trying to deal with these things, I'm very proud of the way Australia does it. You know, I think it's not easy to be a refugee. It's not easy to be a newcomer to this country but I think that overall, when I look around me, we celebrate most of the time the multicultural community that is Australia. TONY JONES: Let's hear from Ian Nelson on this and just to reiterate the question essentially was how do you expect Muslims to integrate and be proud of being Australians when you're essentially saying they shouldn't be here?IAN NELSON: I don't think anybody is saying they shouldn't be here. What we are saying is that we would love them to assimilate. We seem to find through evidence that they don't. Muslims have their own religion and they have their own mosques. They have their own Sharia law. They have their own Bible, the Quran, which is really different than what we do. I don't know what's funny about that. I mean it's a serious problem. It's not that we don't like their religion. They don't like our religion. No, wait a minute. Is it true that they're offended by the scene of the nativity during Christmas time? I mean, is that true? Is that true? The mayor of Sydney doesn't allow anybody to display it. That's our Christianity.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Exactly.IAN NELSON: I mean you folks just don't...YEHYA EL KHOLED: (Indistinct) problem with Christianity. You have a problem with us.TONY JONES: Hang on. We'll get a microphone to you. Just hang on a sec.IAN NELSON: I've lived and worked with Muslims...TONY JONES: Just hang on for a second. We've just got to hear from our questioner.YEHYA EL KHOLED: We don't have a problem with Christianity. We don't have a problem with anyone in Australia. These people, I'll take a bullet for these people, but I do have a problem that it's always Islam, Muslim, Islam, Muslim. Do you think it's easy? My wife gets spat at in the streets. All these like millions of things happens. If it wasn't for the people that I've known throughout my life, I would have told my wife these people are bad but obviously they're not because there's so much more people out here respect my wife and respect me but it really, really - you make life hard for all Muslims the way you act and the way you just always Islam, Muslim. We don't hate your religion. We believe Jesus as our profit. We love Jesus. We love - you know, I don't know where you get all these ideologies from. IAN NELSON: A couple of years ago, the president and myself went and visited a mosque on the Gold Coast and we found those Imams to be absolutely charming and the people there were also charming, very charming. These people - the Muslims there, they seem to have assimilated and they're practicing a diversified culture. They're not multiculture. They're practicing a diversified culture and they mix with other religions too. These folks are wonderful. We welcome them. It's the scary speeches your imams give in the Sydney mosques that scare the living daylights out of all of us. It's the burka, which is - which is an intimidating thing to see at the best of times. We understand it's your religion but you've got to understand that we have a religion too and we want to be free to practice that.TONY JONES: Can I go to Barnaby Joyce on this? Barnaby Joyce, are you and some of your colleagues playing with the fears of Muslims that exist in some parts of the community?BARNABY JOYCE: No, I'm not, Tony, but I get a sense that we're starting to do that here tonight...IAN NELSON: Yeah, we're doing it tonight.BARNABY JOYCE: ...which I don't like at all. I believe that, you know, it's a ridiculous question, should we have more of one group? Because as soon as you say we're going to have more of one group, it means you must have less of another. I think it's your - the greatest gift you have is to come into this nation and it should be given to those who want to participate in this nation in a way that shows some sort of a unified purpose, whatever that is. I don't think it's determined by religion or creed or colour or anything else but it's your desire when you turn up here to pick up the papers and not walk past them, be a member of the defence force, a member of the police force, to participate in a civic way. It's a very easy argument, Tony, to turn this into some sort of...TONY JONES: You would...BARNABY JOYCE: I mean, this is dog whistle - I'm watching you. This is dog whistle stuff on two directions.TONY JONES: You would have seen the reports...BARNABY JOYCE: Well, it is. It's...TONY JONES: You would have seen the reports last week suggesting that Scott Morrison raised the potency of this issue in shadow cabinet.BARNABY JOYCE: Well, the first thing with that, that's wrong. I mean, that was a report that was wrong and so, you know, let's start from (indistinct) and, once more, it incites on both directions. If you put out something that is false, it is just as 'inciteful' as putting out something that is correct that you shouldn't have said. So we have to be extremely careful of how we do this. We have a peaceful nation. We want to try and keep it that way and we do it by not antagonising from either direction, Tony.TONY JONES: Can I just get Gina Castelain's view on this?GINA CASTELAIN: Well, I just want to say when everybody cuts themself, we all bleed red. We're all people. We should all respect one another. We should all respect each other's beliefs, each other's cultures, all be free to practice whatever rituals we want to practice. I think - I'm proud to be an Australian and I'm proud that we're a multicultural country and that's just the way it should be.TONY JONES: Okay, we've got a few people with their hands up in the air. We'll try and get microphones over to you over in the centre there and in the meantime we'll take a question from Andrea Nelligan.ANDREA NELLIGAN: Does the panel think that allowing people into Australia who came from misogynist and undemocratic cultures, where church and state are intermingled, is a good idea for Australias future?TONY JONES: Tim Flannery, do you want to pick up that point?TIM FLANNERY: Sure. Look, I think we are all Australians equal under the law and it is a disgrace - just to refer to that previous question - for politicians to discriminate among Australians. People who cross over and break the law, sure, wherever they come from they should feel the full weight of the law but we do have a multicultural society here. The Muslim religion and people who adhere to that religion have played a very, very proud part in the building of our nation, from the Afghan cameleers onwards and I just don't think we can afford any discrimination. Sure, we may not all agree about social mores and so forth but, you know, I remember when I was a kid going to the Catholic church with the women had to wear something over their head. We took Lent equally as seriously as Muslims take Ramadan. People and cultures change over time and I think that we will build a more common understanding as we go on.TONY JONES: Anna Bligh, the question was: does the panel think allowing people into Australia who come from misogynist and undemocratic cultures, where church and state are intermingled, is a good idea?ANNA BLIGH: Well, I think many people who leave those countries leave them because they're looking for something different and something better and that's what Australia offers them and I don't think, as Tim said, there's nothing new about that now. People have been seeking to come to democratic countries that provide opportunity, like Australia, like the United States, like the United Kingdom, for centuries. You know, if people are oppressed and kept down for long enough they will seek something better for themselves and their families. So it's often the very things that you're talking about that drive people. I mean, I can't imagine going and becoming a citizen of another country. I think it must be very hard and that people are often driven because they're looking for something different and better for themselves and their children. So I think we do need to understand that some of the people who come here and seek to become Australians are coming from countries that do not have the same system of government or the same culture and that's actually one of the reasons why people want to come here, because they're looking for that. But it's equally true that culture, when we say multiculture, that culture is not just about eating different food and speaking a different language. It does come down to your faith, your religion, your social beliefs and, you know, it's not only people from different countries that have different views. I've got, you know, six generation Australians, you know, in my family who hold different views than me and we have good political arguments about it and that's okay. TONY JONES: Okay, we've got a few people with their hands up in the audience. I'll go to this gentleman down the front here. We're going to change topics shortly, but just let's hear what a few people in the audience have to say.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just considering the way that the audience has been responding to what's been said - do you think and this is specifically for the one nation member - do you think maybe that this is a bit more of an old school thought of, oh, they must be different, whereas the community here, at least, seems to be saying, look, generally peace to all me, freedom of expression...BARNABY JOYCE: Women.AUDIENCE MEMBER: ...to all men and women, thank you, Barnaby, but generally that those are the major fundamentals of each of these religions. Not just Muslim but all of them and that that needs to be something that's promoted?TONY JONES: I'm going to take that as a comment. We'll come back to you. There's a gentleman with his hand up just behind you there. We're just getting a microphone to you. One second. Yes, go ahead.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah, my question, I said to say it a little bit earlier, but it was about mandatory detention. We've had it since 1993. Has any government really done a cost benefit analysis on it and, you know, what purpose does it serve? We're one of the few countries in the world that has mandatory detention.TONY JONES: Okay. All right. That is a little bit off the topic we were talking about. I'm going to take that as a comment again and we had a questioner down the front here. We'll just try and get a microphone over to you quickly, sir. Yes, just right down the front here. Okay, we're getting a microphone to you. Hang on.AUDIENCE MEMBER: The media. Do you think the media have a lot to answer for regarding this gentleman up here in the lovely blue shirt that we excel this. We get on there and we just take the Mickey out of it and we see people in the western suburbs and it's always Middle Eastern. It's always to this race and I think, I don't know, do you think the media has something to do with it, as well?TONY JONES: Look, we'll throw that to Anna Bligh.BARNABY JOYCE: Sounds like a question to Tony Jones.TONY JONES: If you want to blame the media, that's fine with me.BARNABY JOYCE: We'll take that as a comment.TONY JONES: All right. I think we have heard a range of views on this topic. It is time to move along. Go to something else. You're watching Q&amp;A;, where you ask the questions and the next question comes from Miso Stojkovski.MISO STOJKOVSKI: Premier Bligh, the recent polls have deservedly approved of your handling of the flood disaster; however many questions remain about the government's handling of preparations and planning to avoid the disaster from ever occurring in the first place. Will you guarantee that you will wait until after the final flood report to call the elections, so that the people can make a fully informed decision at the polling booths?ANNA BLIGH: Thank you. It's true that we've been through an extraordinary time and some of the disasters, I think, have - some of the flooding are pretty easily explained and in other parts there are some very legitimate questions, particularly in relation to the two specific questions I've put to the commission of inquiry. One, the early warning systems and forecasting in relation to the terrible events in the Toowoomba and Lockyer Valley and, two, the operation of the Wivenhoe Dam and whether, firstly, was it operated as it was required to be and, two, the requirements, were they appropriate for the event as it occurred. I'm not in a position to judge that and we've put in place a panel that I think everybody on all sides of politics accepts is a genuinely independent, capable and expert group of commissioners, with all the powers of a royal commission of inquiry. I've asked them to do two things: one, give us an interim - give the public an interim report in August if there are any issues which they believe we need to know in time for the next wet season and, secondly, to give a report in the end of - I think 17 January, which is 12 months from when we set them up because, again, 12 months is an amount of time I think you want for a royal commission. The next election is not due until March 2012 and I've said numerous times in the last week, because I've had a cabinet reshuffle everyone's got very excited about an election. Can I tell you, the cabinet reshuffle is about the task we've got ahead of us. We've got a massive reconstruction task. It's without precedent in our country and frankly I think that if I did anything other than rebuild Queensland this year I'd be doing the wrong thing by Queensland.TONY JONES: So is that a promise that you won't have an early election.ANNA BLIGH: That's right.TONY JONES: That's right.ANNA BLIGH: That's right.TONY JONES: Okay. Barnaby Joyce. I agree with the premier that really the - obviously I think the premier did a good job during the floods and to say anything else would be not correct but the decision the people of Queensland will make is what happens after the floods and how you deal with that and how you manage getting it back on the road so to speak. We have already people in Rockhampton, the mayor of Rockhampton, who is starting to say, look, the promises that were made are not being delivered. We've got the mayor of Brisbane saying the promises that were made are not being delivered and now we're going to start seeing this political football passed around as to who is actually responsible for fixing things. Empathy is extremely important and has been delivered in spades and now it's the part where you actually have to deliver an outcome and if you don't deliver the outcome you won't be the government.TONY JONES: Okay, I'll more quickly into our next question. We've got quite a few questions on the whole issue or all the issues surrounding the flooding and the disasters in Queensland. Our next question comes from Samuel Glen.SAMUEL GLEN: Hi. My question is for the Premier. Why do we need a flood levy introduced? Do you know how much is needed to bring Queensland back to full function, without needing to burn holes in our pockets?ANNA BLIGH: Thank you. These disasters without precedent in Australia's history. We've had floods before. We've had cyclones. But we've never had in any state of Australia all of them at once over such a large area in such catastrophic proportions. The disaster arrangements in Australia that have prevailed under all sides of politics for more than a decade - I think a couple of decades now, are a set of arrangements by which the commonwealth government pays 75 per cent of the cost of restoring essential public infrastructure. Not just state infrastructure but much of what gets damaged in these things are the infrastructure of local councils and what we've got is a great example of it here in Queensland. Many of the councils worst affected are some of the smallest councils in Australia. So the roads that they have are really important to everyone, but they've actually got a very small group of ratepayers and a very small ability to cope with fixing it. And the state government pays 25 per cent. So we've got the money to pay our 25 per cent but it will really stretch our budget. The Commonwealth are saying in order for us to fix something of this scale, not only in Queensland - they've this massive event in Queensland, as well as what happened in Victoria and to some extent Western Australia. They're saying in these circumstances we need Australians to pitch in and help in a way that Australians have done before. We did it for the milk industry. We've done it for the sugar industry. We did it for the gun buyback when John Howard made those reforms. There are just some times when things happens that are so extreme and so beyond the planning of any government that it's important that, you know, you add to that by some one-off supplement, which is what the Federal Government is asking for.TONY JONES: Let's hear Barnaby Joyce on this subject as well, because you're against the levy.BARNABY JOYCE: Yeah. Yeah. First of all, we had tens of billions of dollars but away for a rainy day. It's just that Mr Rudd spent it in the first 10 months. That's where your money went and now we are 100 - well, it's true. Now you're $182 billion in gross debt and the week they announced the levy you borrowed - you, because you're going to pay it back, you borrowed $4 billion that week. So this levy would have covered you for three days of that. So you got to start getting things into perspective about exactly where we're off to here. Now, what we've said is there are other things that we can put off. We don't have to be buying back the water to put back in the river when the river is flooded right now. That can actually wait a little while. We can actually start putting off some of these other costs so that we can really fundamentally get the books back in shape, otherwise we're just tinkering at the edges and you've got to remember this levy is not to fix houses. It's not to fix personal things. It's to fix the government's - the government's problem. And the other thing you've got to remember is the difference between Queensland and the other states is the other states are insured. Queensland is not for some reason that I'm sure the Premier will explain.ANNA BLIGH: I'll come back there. TONY JONES: Just hold on for a second, Barnaby Joyce, because we actually just had a tweet come in. Someone is watching this debate. A tweet has come in and it says, "So Bligh, why does Queensland not have insurance for disasters like the other states."ANNA BLIGH: That's a very good question. I'm very pleased to have a chance to answer it. For exactly the same reason that under John Howard the Commonwealth Government decided not to be insured either and that is because it is not cost effective in a state as big as Queensland. We went out to the market about seven years ago. The cost of - well, first of all they won't insure us for roads. They don't ensure New South Wales for roads. They don't ensure other states. You can't get insured for roads. More than 80 per cent of the cost of this disaster is roads. So when we went out to the market and said we are a big state that has a lot of disasters and we want insurance, the cost of getting the insurance as actually more than it was for effectively self-insure. So we are doing the exactly the same as the Commonwealth decided to do under the Howard Government, which is also not insured. What it does is self insure, because it's more cost effective for taxpayers.BARNABY JOYCE: Oh, yeah.ANNA BLIGH: Well, it is true, Barnaby.BARNABY JOYCE: Well, no, but what happens when you self insure is that you put aside a provision.ANNA BLIGH: And that's what we've done.BARNABY JOYCE: So, Premier, did you put aside money to actually cover for this in the future/ANNA BLIGH: Yes, we did. We put aside...BARNABY JOYCE: Well, where did it go.ANNA BLIGH: We put aside money - happy to answer. We put aside money in every budget for disasters because we are so regularly affected by them.BARNABY JOYCE: Okay, well, how about the last budget? How much did you put aside there?ANNA BLIGH: We put aside just under $700 million and this disaster will cost us more than that because we did not forecast something of this magnitude. But, nevertheless, we will be in a position to pay our share - Queensland's share under the disaster arrangements that have prevailed under both sides of politics for many years. But, you know, put all of that aside. I guess what I would say to every Federal politician, if you don't think this levy is worth it, come to my state. Come and have a look at the people in Tully heads. Come and have a look at the people in Chinchilla and Dalby, out in Barnaby's area. Come and have look in the suburbs of Brisbane and what you'll find are people - just ordinary Australians who need help and they expect other Australians to say, 'We're here for you.'TONY JONES: Barnaby Joyce, can I just intercede here, because a point was made earlier, and it's a relevant one. I mean, you're not actually against levies, are you, as a...BARNABY JOYCE: No.TONY JONES: ...as the previous government, the Howard government introduced - was it half a dozen levies?BARNABY JOYCE: Okay, but let...TONY JONES: ...including for the gun buyback, for milk deregulation...BARNABY JOYCE: Sure. Yeah, sure.TONY JONES: ...to pay off Ansett employees.BARNABY JOYCE: Okay.TONY JONES: So why not for Queensland?BARNABY JOYCE: Well, for a couple of reasons. First of all the levy for something that's foreseeable is different to a levy for something that's not, like the gun buyback. People are already donating out of their own pockets. In fact donating far more...ANNA BLIGH: How is milk deregulation not foreseeable? You made it happen.BARNABY JOYCE: ...donating far more - donating far more out of their own pockets than you're actually asking for them now you've compulsorily asking them to put their hand in. You're actually walking over the top of the compassion that was in place, that we've actually put on the table the capacity to find the money from elsewhere and that - when you talk about Tully Heads, there's always this inference that we're going out there to fix the houses. We're not. We're going out to fix the government's roads that they failed to fix themselves.ANNA BLIGH: Well, hang on. Hang on. That's important. I think it's really important here. The council that oversees Tully is a great little council. I think it's probably one of the smallest councils in Australia and most of the roads in that area are council roads and they need state help, and I'm happy to give it, and they need Federal Government help and I hope they can give it.BARNABY JOYCE: And we're happy to give it but we're not happy to give it out of their pockets. We can put aside money from other areas and give them that.TONY JONES: Okay, hang on a sec. Ian Nelson - I'll just bring Ian Nelson in here, because you have essentially the same position as the coalition. In fact, The Australian newspaper last week reported the coalition policy was one hatched in One Nation heartland. That's the policy on the flood levy. What do you say to that?IAN NELSON: Well, Tony, we've had a policy in place now since 1998 to have national disaster fund. We're had that in place since 1998. We saw that as an imperative and nobody listened. Now, I guess we're looking at disaster after disaster and we're out of money. We haven't got any money. So how do we do this? Okay, there's one simple, fine way to do it. Our foreign aid is shot over $4.4 billion. You've got to hear me out here. $4.4 billion. We need 2.2 billion to get us up and going. 2.2 just for two or three years. What on earth is wrong with that? We've got Queenslanders living in tents at the moment and I can't help but think that my heart goes out to them.TONY JONES: Okay. Barnaby Joyce, is that an appealing notion to you, because it did seem to be to some of your coalition colleagues. BARNABY JOYCE: We don't believe in cutting aid. We believe that there might be an instance to defer until such a period of time, which is like two years, till such period of time as we have looked after our priority first. We've got to look after the people in our own state, in our own nation first and I think other nations would understand that completely if they were in our position.TONY JONES: Okay. We're going to move on again to a slightly different topic but still related to this. Tom Fardoulys has a question.TOM FARDOULYS: My question goes to all the panellists. Many prominent figures in the media and political circles have been quick to link Queensland's summer of extreme weather to human induced climate change. Is it naive to make the connection between CO2 emissions and extreme weather, or are we really to blame for our state's worst natural disaster in living memory?TONY JONES: Tim Flannery? Your job will be to explain this to people. Let's start now.TIM FLANNERY: Thank you. Thank you, Tony. Look, could I just start with the observation that for the last quarter of last year, the last three months of last year, we saw sea surface temperatures across northern Australian and western Australia that broke all records and warm water, of course, evaporates and creates rainfall much more readily than cool water. Not surprisingly we saw rainfall across eastern Australia. It's telling us we're outside the historic envelope of occurrences. At the same time in the south west of Australia we saw a drought that broke all records and that is ongoing. So there's evidence that we are moving outside the historic envelope of events that we knew previously. Now, individual weather events like floods, it's very, very hard to link them to a changing climate because they are weather events but climate science just in the last few months has made some significant breakthroughs in that area and two major scientific studies have emerged that link floods particularly with the changing climate. One of them links increased CO2 in the atmosphere with the increased level of flooding across the northern hemisphere over the last decade or two. The other one links a specific flood event, particularly the flood in Wales, with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. So we are now getting to the point where we can actually do that. We can link individual weather events to the greenhouse gases. For the southern hemisphere we're not there yet and I've asked the scientists that advise the climate commission to give us a reading on where we are in terms of linking things in the southern hemisphere. But the basic physics is the same. There's no reason to assume it will be different down here so we are slowly building those links towards particularly floods, flood events and climate change.TONY JONES: Ross Garnaut was heavily criticised in some quarters for daring to link the floods and cyclones in Queensland to climate change. Are you wary of doing that?TIM FLANNERY: Look, I think we need to take the science as it is and the science is probablistic, right, so people are talking about 90 per cent plus probabilities of these links. It's important to recognise that. It's also important to recognise that, in the southern hemisphere, we don't have the same wealth of data that let us do the statistical analyses we need to get that degree of certainty as yet. It may come eventually but we don't quite have it yet. So we need to talk about probabilities and we need to recognise the science where it is. But it is leaning towards, particularly in the northern hemisphere, a link - establishing a link between flooding and climate change.TONY JONES: Let's hear from Gina. How does this look from Cape York, this story?GINA CASTELAIN: Well, with climate change I think, you know, there is a weight of evidence out there that appears to fairly and solidly be behind the reality of climate change. In Cape York we're already - traditional owners who are working out on country on cultural and natural resource management projects are already noticing changes on the ground: rising sea levels, plants are starting to flower before they're actually supposed to flower. You know, there's a wealth of traditional ecological knowledge there amongst, you know, traditional owners all over northern Australia and, you know, we have a Waterways and Wetlands and Coastal Advisory Committee. We work closely with scientists, you know, such as Tim and I think we really need to take this seriously, you know. And I think that we all have a role to play. I think that government has a role to play, industry has a role to play, individuals have a role to play in minimising the effects of climate change. TONY JONES: Barnaby Joyce, what's your role in this?BARNABY JOYCE: My role is the other side of the argument, isn't it? But, look...TONY JONES: To be the other side of the argument?BARNABY JOYCE: Yeah, well, obviously. TONY JONES: Well, what is the other side of the argument?BARNABY JOYCE: Well, the other side of the argument is you've got to match predictions up with what people have said. Now, I've heard Mr Flannery before say that Brisbane was going to run out of water. Well, we certainly didn't - that didn't happen. Look, you have people saying, well, the model that predicts where Cyclone Yasi went is exactly the same models they use to predict climate change. Well, models have been round predicting the directions of cyclones - have been around for years and been improved over years and if this model is so good, then let's run it backwards and see what happened to the climate last year. Every person who has a barrow to push - you must understand if people are getting paid to investigate something, they will keep on investigating it because they will keep - by investigating it they keep on getting paid and, you know, so I do come to this with a sense of scepticism and I always like to hear both sides of the argument. I like to hear - I like to hear proficient scientists who have different views and they - they're out there and I know that you don't agree with them, Tony, but, you know, I'll keep my mind open to the debate and I won't be locked into sort of a categorical belief one way or the other.TONY JONES: Yes, you actually have introduced to public meetings in your own electorate climate sceptics.BARNABY JOYCE: That's correct.TONY JONES: Some of whom are scientists, indeed.BARNABY JOYCE: Yep.TONY JONES: So I'm wondering would you now be prepared to bring Tim Flannery into your electorate, because his job is now to explain the opposite argument.BARNABY JOYCE: I would love to bring - I would love to bring Tim Flannery in but just before I start, Tim, are you actually a climatologist?TIM FLANNERY: A climatologist?BARNABY JOYCE: Yeah.TIM FLANNERY: No, I'm...BARNABY JOYCE: What's do you have your PhD in?TIM FLANNERY: My PhD is in palaeontology.BARNABY JOYCE: Palaeontology.TIM FLANNERY: So, right, with an interest in past climates and all of that sort of stuff. BARNABY JOYCE: Yeah.TIM FLANNERY: The group that I work with now has Australia's best climate scientists on it. We're working together to bring some clarity to this thing.BARNABY JOYCE: But I mean, so the point is I would happily bring Tim in if I wanted to have a discussion about palaeontology. TIM FLANNERY: Can I just say - can I just say, Barnaby, I think you've taken a few pretty cheap shots there. I really do. I think that, you know, scientists are the greatest sceptics out there. The second you find someone who is absolutely certain about something, as some of the climate sceptics are, you know you're not dealing with a scientist who is serious about...BARNABY JOYCE: Well, (indistinct) because I see what happened to people like Clive Spash at the CSIRO and how he was bundled out because he dared to differ. He dared to stand up and say, "I disagree." You know, I see what's happened to other people who have basically been ridiculed and persecuted so I think it's only fair that at times I stand up for the other side.TONY JONES: Let me hear from - sorry, go ahead. You can respond to that.TIM FLANNERY: No, look, I just know nothing about those particular cases but...BARNABY JOYCE: You don't know about Clive Spash from the CSIRO?TIM FLANNERY: No, I don't know about his bundling our or anything...BARNABY JOYCE: You don't know about - well then (indistinct).TIM FLANNERY: But can I just say the point that we need to make, right, is that why don't we listen to the mainstream science? Why don't we actually take it onboard with all of the issues about probabilities and so forth, and deal with this as an insurance issue or an issue of probabilities rather than I just don't believe it. That doesn't cut anymore. Too much is at stake.BARNABY JOYCE: Well, we can have - we can have an insurance issue on malaria, on a whole range of issues. I mean, that is an argument that you could put into any semblance of a problem. Let's use the insurance argument.TONY JONES: Okay, I'm going to just interrupt this Socratic dialogue for a moment to hear from Anna Bligh. Do you believe that Ross Garnaut was right to directly link the extreme weather events to the situation in Queensland and say essentially that Queenslanders in particular should support action against climate change?ANNA BLIGH: Look, I've always said that Queensland has a particular interest in the climate change debate. One, because we are a large state with extreme weather. We always have been. What I'm concerned about when I look at what's happening - you know, we've had a category 5 cyclone before. It was in 1918 and we had two of them, I think, in two months and then nothing like that for 100 years. We've had massive floods before: 1974 here in Brisbane. But these were events that - like, 1974 flood I think people thought that was going to be the biggest flood you'd ever see in your lifetime. Well, we've now had two in a lifetime and I plan to be around for a while and, you know, I have to plan for the prospect there might be another one. It's not so much that I think there's a direct cause that necessarily this - the climate caused that flood but that these events are at risk of becoming more regular and more frequent that I think - so it's not necessarily that, you know, this bit of burning coal caused that flood. I don't think you'll ever get that but something that indicates to me that weather patterns are changing, that the world is - the temperatures are getting hotter, that water temperatures are getting higher on a more regular basis, I don't think we can ignore that and I guess I go to Barnaby's point. I mean, Barnaby, I'm in the same situation as you. I'm not highly trained as a scientist. I do believe - I believe in listening to the scientists and they sometimes disagree with each other but I guess I think - and scientists have been known to be wrong on some important things. I understand that but I think in this case if they're right and we make all the plans and change some of the things we're doing then we're in a good position. If they're wrong and we've changed some of things, what harm have we done?TONY JONES: Okay.ANNA BLIGH: You know, why don't we take that risk?TONY JONES: We've got a few people with their hands up, so we'll just get a microphone to, first of all, the young lady in the black there. We'll get a microphone to you. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Does the panel agree with Bob Brown's assertion that the mining companies should have to foot the bill for the floods, despite the fact that many of those companies, such as BHP and Rio, have already donated quite generously?TONY JONES: Yes, let's hear from our One Nation colleague on that.IAN NELSON: I didn't quite hear all that question.TONY JONES: Bob Brown has suggested that the mining copies, being partially responsible, in his view, for the floods due to the climate change...BARNABY JOYCE: It was a bit stronger than...TONY JONES: ...should be paying...BARNABY JOYCE: It was a bit stronger than partially responsible. He said that the coal barons caused the flood.IAN NELSON: Yeah, the coal barons are responsible, yeah.TONY JONES: Well, let's get your response to it. IAN NELSON: You're going to get a lot of Bob Brown in July the 1st this year and I can assure you that that's a very dangerous position to be in. Everybody is saying how wonderful it is that the mainstream scientists have proven this. Well, what about the other guys that didn't agree with it, never got on TV, banned from television studios, didn't have a say? As I understand it CO2 is the enemy. Is that right? Carbon Tax? Is CO2 the enemy?TIM FLANNERY: Too much is not good for the planet, that's for sure.IAN NELSON: Too much is not good for the planet. Okay. That's ridiculous. How could there be too much CO2 in the air? I mean 338 parts per million of trace elements in the atmosphere right now. How can that be too much? It's never going to reach that position where it's going to be a critical mass. What I've got to say to you is that this is going to change the lifestyle of everyone one of us, simply and solely because it's going to cost you a lot more money. If you think this is carbon tax is something that you could laugh off, the GST is just a baby compared to this baby, I can tell, you.TONY JONES: Okay. All right. We've got a few other people with their hands up. Let's go to this gentleman right down the front here. We'll get a microphone to you.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Why is nuclear power not on the table from any politician at the moment?TONY JONES: I'll ask the ALP President that, because that debate will be coming up in your conference, I believe.ANNA BLIGH: It will be. TONY JONES: Why is nuclear power not part of this debate since it's clean energy theoretically.ANNA BLIGH: Theoretically. Well, I think there's a couple of reasons. Certainly I can only talk about the Labor Party. Other people can talk about other groups but I think there is a genuine view held by a number of people in the Labor Party that there are still a range of safety and other issues associated with nuclear power. Now, there are many countries around the world that take a majority of their power from this source and it's a different - I guess the world is changing and the technology may well give more people who have been worried about it in the past some more comfort. But it's equally true that when you look at a source of power, you also have to look at its feasibility and its cost, et cetera. It was, in fact, John Howard who had the most recent thorough look at the applicability of this source of power in Australia. He had Ziggy Switkowski do the report for him and his assessment really was that at this point, without population and our electricity distribution network, it would be an incredibly expensive source of power that no one would make money out of so the private sector wouldn't build it and Australians wouldn't want to pay the price of the power. Now, that doesn't mean that that won't change over time. That's the most recent assessment of it.TONY JONES: Okay, just before I go to you, Barnaby, I'd just like to hear from Tim Flannery. Nuclear power: good or bad idea for Australia?TIM FLANNERY: Look, I think that in Australia we have such an abundance of renewable sources of energy. We've got great wind provinces, potentially very good geothermal and fantastic solar. Nuclear is always going to be economically disadvantaged. Now, as the premier said, that may change, I guess, in time but at the moment you look at the money going into wind and photovoltaics is very substantial. We haven't yet seen that sort of push with the nuclear.IAN NELSON: (Indistinct).TONY JONES: Barnaby Joyce, just very briefly, because we've got to move to other...BARNABY JOYCE: Yeah, I think the thing - everyone believes that this is some sort of esoteric debate but unfortunately for people who can't afford the power it's not and what's happening is policies now are forcing up the price of power so that people who can least afford it can't run their air conditioner, can't run their heater, are going without because of our desire to try and create, you know, green power. It is costing people and we just can't do it. It is something wrong that the people in Singapore deliver cheaper power to their people - 30 per cent cheaper to their people with our coal than what we can deliver to our people with our coal.TONY JONES: Yeah, go on. Quickly respond to that. I'm sorry, you'll have...ANNA BLIGH: Well, I would just say, as someone who has to provide power to one of the biggest parts of the country, it's much cheaper to provide power in Singapore that's that big (MAKES SMALL CIRCLE WITH FINGERS) rather than having to provide it to the Northern Territory or, sorry, to Cape York and that's (indistinct).BARNABY JOYCE: As you know, Premier, they actually have to move the coal 6,300 kilometres before it gets to the power station. ANNA BLIGH: Not the cost of generation. No.BARNABY JOYCE: That is kind of a bit of a journey as opposed to the power station which is actually in the coal field.TONY JONES: All right.ANNA BLIGH: You know as well as I do it's the distribution network that costs the money. It's pumping it out there to people's homes.BARNABY JOYCE: So we're incapable of delivering cheap power in Queensland.ANNA BLIGH: Was this an argument for nuclear power?BARNABY JOYCE: Well, I think that if you're going to have a choice between total renewables and nuclear then you better start having a look at your nuclear.ANNA BLIGH: So why didn't you do it when you were in government?BARNABY JOYCE: Because we had coal - we were delivering coal. We were delivering cheap coal. Since the Labor Party has been in there, the price of utilities has been going up 10 per cent a year and that's by reason of your bad management.TONY JONES: Okay, you're watching Q&amp;A; live from the Brisbane Powerhouse on a stormy night in South East Queensland. A bit stormy in here from time to time and our next question comes from Peter Black. PETER BLACK asked: There are many reasons to be critical of our political leaders of late and we've discussed some of those tonight: immigration, asylum seekers, climate change and the unexpected return of One Nation to the national agenda. But is the reason why our media and our politicians continue to seem to be in a race to the bottom because it's simply good politics? And so my question is are we getting the bad government and leaders we deserve?TONY JONES: Gina Castelain, let's start with you on that. Are we getting the bad leaders and the bad government we deserve?GINA CASTELAIN: Well...ANNA BLIGH: (Indistinct)GINA CASTELAIN: You caught me by surprise, Tony. Well, there are good leaders, there are bad leaders, you know. I think we have very good leadership at the moment. Go the females. But...TONY JONES: Do you mean generally female leaders plural or just the one that's sitting next to me?GINA CASTELAIN: Plural. No, I really need more time to think about that question.TONY JONES: Don't you worry about it. Let's go to Barnaby Joyce to hear this. Are we getting the leadership we deserve?BARNABY JOYCE: Well, you get the leadership you vote for, don't you.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hear, hear.BARNABY JOYCE: And that...ANNA BLIGH: I agree with him.BARNABY JOYCE: But one of the problems we've got in the last election is actually we got the leaders we didn't vote for. We got the leaders the independents gave us which is a bit disappointing I suppose for me but not for if you're in the Labor Party. I think you've got to be really careful not to ridicule politics or to continue to run it down. If you do, you just create a sense that I don't want to go into that field. We want to make sure that we attract the best and the brightest and the people who love our nation and want to take it ahead and if you keep on making a joke of it, well, you'll suffer because you'll end up with the people here that you really did create.TONY JONES: Ian Nelson?IAN NELSON: Well, yeah, we have got some pretty poor leaders at the moment and I have to say that in sincerity. Australia's policies are - you know, there's a different dynamic in Australia right now. I, for one, don't understand why for one minute that we were vilified from 1998. Sure, we were 10 years ahead of our time, our policies and...(AUDIENCE LAUGH)IAN NELSON: How many of you have read the One Nation website policies? I ask you: how many have you read that? We have had policies in there since 1998. We have had population policies. We have had water policies, infrastructure policies. We have a disaster fund policies and you people think that's really funny, do you? Well, I've got to say to you, you need to - what you need to do is do a little bit more reading. Go into www.onenationqueensland.com.au and have a look. You know, we were only too pleased to show that our policies have been there since 1998.TONY JONES: Okay. That's a unique pitch to the voters.IAN NELSON: We don't get many chances, Tony.TONY JONES: Gina?GINA CASTELAIN: I would like to say one thing. I mean the strongest leadership skills I've seen in a long time actually came from our Premier just over the last couple of weeks. I was absolutely amazed, you know, during Cyclone Yasi. You know, I was absolutely amazed at the government's response. You know, I was getting text messages, you know, regularly, every hour or two hour about evacuation, about the power going off. You know, we were being kept well-informed, I think. I'd just like to say thank you, Premier, for such a wonderful job during, you know, that crisis. TONY JONES: Anna Bligh...ANNA BLIGH: (Indistinct)TONY JONES: Well, I guess the real question is if you've bucked the trend. I mean, you're one of the few political leaders in this country that's actually now getting good ratings. Although that is rather recent, I have to admit. What's your secret?ANNA BLIGH: Well, I'm actually going to go back to that gentleman's question and try to answer it seriously.TONY JONES: Yes. Yes, good.ANNA BLIGH: You know, I think it is important to remember that while - it's often the extremes of politics and the extreme views on the left and the right and in religious terms and others that occupies some of the public space because they're the more colourful and we're drawn - one way or another people either get sort of attracted to them or are repelled by them. That often occupies a lot of the public space but, you know, in my experience, if I look over, you know, what Australia has done over, you know, decades, by and large it's my experience in Australia that the mob pretty well gets it right at elections. I don't always agree with it. There's no pleasure in losing but, you know, if you actually look at how Australia manages its democracy, I think we've - you know we've done a pretty good job if you look at how we've done it since federation and, you know, we've pretty much elected governments - some have been better than others on both sides of politics, but we've elected people that have actually made us a pretty good place and, you know, I think that's a reflection of the strength of Australia's democracy and that people by and large take their vote seriously and do the best with it.TONY JONES: Okay, the charm offensive continues but that's all we have time for tonight. Please thank our panellists: Barnaby Joyce, Ian Nelson, Gina Castelain, Anna Bligh, and Tim Flannery. Okay. Next Monday on Q&amp;A; we'll be joined by Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten; Shadow Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull; UN Youth Representative Samah Hadid; political commentator Piers Akerman; author, comedian and former Big Brother host Gretel Killeen. That's for joining us. Good night.TONY JONES: Good evening. Welcome to Q&amp;A.; I'm Tony Jones and answering your questions tonight political strategist and Federal Director of Barton Deakin Government Relations Grahame Morris; Minister for Sport and Multicultural Affairs, Kate Lundy; singer, songwriter and member of the stolen generation, Archie Roach; the Zimbabwe Minister for National Healing and Reconciliation, winner of the 2012 Sydney Peace Prize, Sekai Holland; and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Eric Abetz. Please welcome our panel.Q&amp;A; is live from 9:35 eastern daylight saving time. It is simulcast on News 24 and News Radio. Go to our website to send a question or join the Twitter conversation using the hash tag that just appeared on your screen. Well, our first question tonight comes from Brian Adamson.POLITICS AND POPULARITYBRIAN ADAMSON: Thank you, Tony. Both major parties are currently led by people considered less popular than their immediate predecessors and Penny Wong has recently been relegated to second spot on the Senate ballot in South Australia. Why does it seem that members of both parties are putting their own self-interest ahead of the national interest?TONY JONES: Grahame, Morris, let's start with you.GRAHAME MORRIS: Well, the Penny Wong one is quite unusual. You know, somebody who is about number five in the Prime Minister's pecking order got relegated by her own team in South Australia in the Senate ticket and I think she was quite entitled to ask the people, well, what is wrong with me? Everyone else likes me but my own people don't. But, look, pre-selections in politics is a difficult game. It is all about numbers and I think many people think that if you cannot get numbers at your own grass roots level you're going to drown by the time you get to Canberra and there's something sort of going wrong, I think, with the pre-selections around the country where I think there are too many party hacks, too many political operatives like me, too many trade union people and not enough real bloody people going into politics. They've got to get through the system.TONY JONES: You could just fall on your sword and get out of it and solve the problem, Grahame, but you don't seem to be doing that any time.GRAHAME MORRIS: No, but I'm not an elected official and I'm not standing for blinking parliament. I wouldn't dare. Itd bore me.TONY JONES: Very briefly, what about the core of that question or the front of it was about the leaders and the question essentially went to the question of whether the national interest is best served by populist leaders or leaders who are backed by party machines?GRAHAME MORRIS: No. One of the problems we have at the moment is that the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader are going at each other so much and we're into gotcha journalism. Nobody wants to make a mistake but they're both going flat out at each other. Theyre both getting wounded in the public face of them and I think people are starting to say why can't we have sort of nicer politicians? But if the journalists keep saying that every time you make a mistake we will get you, you're going to completely - we're always going to have this combative sort of force that people are starting to turn off on but it's hurting both leaders. Both parties are more popular than their leaders.TONY JONES: Kate Lundy.KATE LUNDY: Well, I think the situation we're facing at the moment, we've got a Government with, I think, a very strong leader but faced with just relentless negativity. You do get this, you know, atmosphere of debate and conflict the whole time. Just to have a shot back about Penny Wong's pre-selection: these guys have got Cory Bernardi at the top of their ticket and he's been sacked twice already in his job so, you know, I (indistinct)...TONY JONES: So youre feeling okay, are you, about Penny Wong being dropped to number two in the South Australian Senate ticket?KATE LUNDY: No. Penny Wong is fantastic but I don't think it's right that, you know, again the Libs have got to-TONY JONES: Is she better than the number one candidate? She's a cabinet minister.KATE LUNDY: Well, I think she's certainly a hero of mine.TONY JONES: So the answer to that is yesKATE LUNDY: The answer to that is I think she's fantastic.TONY JONES: So how did that happen?KATE LUNDY: What I want to know is...TONY JONES: Gotcha!KATE LUNDY: Got me. Part of the problem is, I think, that we do have an Opposition that is just, you know, so persistently negative. We're trying to initiate new programs, we've got our Asian White Paper out today and already the opposition without even...TONY JONES: You've got Maxine McKew out today as well.KATE LUNDY: Well, that's right. Everyone has come out from the Opposition and said that the White Paper is, you know, it's no good. They haven't even read it yet. So it doesn't matter what initiative we take as a Federal Labor Government we have an Opposition that will just be negative every step of the way and that does characterise federal politics. I don't believe we're both hurt for it. In fact I think what people are starting to recognise in our Prime Minister is her strength of character and resilience in the face of such negativity and that makes me proud to be a member of her team.TONY JONES: Eric Abetz.ERIC ABETZ: The Prime Minister's difficulty is that she went to the last election saying no carbon tax, we now have a carbon tax and so in the face of that deliberate, misrepresentation to the electorate of course we will point these things out to the people of Australia.TONY JONES: Is that really what the question was about though? I might just bring you back to the point. It was really asking whether the two leaders which are unpopular, whether there's a reason for that; whether self-interest has taken over from the national interest?ERIC ABETZ: I was following on from Kate's comments, I'm sure you understand that, Tony. But in relation to the question, Tony Abbott, no doubt, is the Coalition's most successful leader. You see where the parties were at under Dr Brendan Nelson and under Malcolm Turnbull and then you have a look at where it is today under Tony Abbott and it is way beyond where the Coalition had ever dreamt to be under the previous two leaders. Why did we change leaders? Because we changed our policy in relation to the issue of, Tony, the carbon tax. So we changed leaders to change our policy. The Labor Party changed their leader supposedly because border protection wasn't working, we needed a good mining tax and we had to fix up the carbon pollution situation. Well, if you have a look at Ms Gillard's record, you would have to say that she didn't fix anything after the demise of Kevin Rudd. The only thing she fixed was Kevin Rudd.TONY JONES: We've got a video question, actually, about Tony Abbott. We'll come to that now and then I'll bring in the other panellists after I get your response to that, Eric Abetz. It's from Baz Archer in Leura NSW.ABBOTT FLAT-LINING?BAZ ARCHER: If we accept Joe Hockey's characterisation of the current GDP growth of 2 to 3% as flat-lining, can the panel offer a comparative description of Tony Abbott's net approval rating in the polls which has slipped from net minus one at the last election to net minus 21 this week?TONY JONES: Eric Abetz.ERIC ABETZ: Polls will go up and down and I look forward to the media giving as much coverage to the Essential Poll, which came out today saying that the Coalition is, in fact, sitting on 54% and not 50%. Me thinks the media won't be giving that one as much coverage. But, look, in this state you had a long-term premier who is now the Foreign Minister and when he won government off Nick Greiner his popularity rating was 19%.TONY JONES: Interesting to hear that you're putting more stock in the Galaxy Poll these days than the Newspoll. That will surprise quite a few people.ERIC ABETZ: No, Essential, this is.TONY JONES: Oh, the Essential poll, all right. Okay.ERIC ABETZ: Yeah. Yeah. Look, polls will come and go. At the end of the day what I think we have had in Australia in recent times is a huge diversion courtesy of Mr McTernan that the Labor Party imported to talk about everything but cost of living, power prices, border protection. Come the election, people won't be voting on misogyny and things of that nature, they will be asking who is going to run the country? Are we going to have protected borders? Are we going to have a surplus budget? Are we going to be bringing down the cost of living and the latest real poll was, in fact, in Kate Lundy's own territory, the Australian Capital Territory, where the poll there showed a clear win to Labor and, of course, we now know what happened. The Liberal Party got the biggest vote ever in the Australian Capital Territory's history only ten days ago. TONY JONES: Okay.ERIC ABETZ: So those that take a lot of comfort in the polls, I concentrate on the real polls.TONY JONES: Sekai Holland. Reflect on, if you can, on the two elements of the two questions which you've just heard. One of them is about whether self-interest takes over from national interest. The other one is specifically about Tony Abbott. Watching from a distance, what lessons do you take from Australian politics you could possibly apply to Zimbabwe?SEKAI HOLLAND: Well, I would say on Penny Wong it was really quite a shock to arrive in Australia, watch the news and see that she had actually been relegated because, for us, it's the norm for women that are really strong, that really do stand for the rights of women in the grass roots to actually get relegated. It happens all the time. But I thought in Western countries, especially in Australia, the power politics of really looking at how people say and articulate things would be a thing of the past. So with me, as a foreigner, coming from a country where gender politics is at its really worst in terms of relations, I really was disappointed. On the issue of the polls, I just think that it is really quite important to understand the process of polling and polls related to issues that are taking place at the time and I would say that on the issue of the carbon tax politicians are not tied to statements they make, regardless of what changes take place time after those statements have been made. I think they should really have the right to make statements that - and policy (indistinct) that meet the situation that arises, even after they've made a carbon tax policy decision, if it changes. I think they should be allowed to articulate something else without suffering for it.TONY JONES: Can I ask you a question? You're trying to establish proper democracy in Zimbabwe. Do you take any lessons at all from the Australian system where a popularly elected leader, in Kevin Rudd, can be overthrown within his own party before facing an election?SEKAI HOLLAND: Well, actually, I say, as a Zimbabwean, I should not get involved in local politics because of this...TONY JONES: Apart from the carbon tax.SEKAI HOLLAND: No. No. No. No. No. No. No. The carbon tax was really...TONY JONES: Thats okay. Im sorry.SEKAI HOLLAND: Its been raised. No, thats fine. But I'm saying on what happened internally of course that wasn't the first time it happened in Australia. Remember when Gough Whitlam won the elections resoundingly in '73, what a shock it was that we got up one day and there was the Governor-General reading something at Government House and he was removed. So I think what I take from what happened with Kevin Rudd, who is, incidentally, and Julie Bishop, very good friends of Zimbabwe because they came to monitor the elections in 2000 and gave that really brilliant Commonwealth Report. So both those are our friends. When that happened, what we understood there was that like in Zimbabwe, the political playing field is like banana peels and you really have to tread very carefully with everybody because every vote counts. So we didn't understand what had really happened but what we know as Zimbabweans is that we are cross-party friends. We are friends with whoever is in government and who is not in government in all the countries that are democratic.TONY JONES: Archie Roach, it was Kevin Rudd who made the apology to the stolen generation. First of all, was it a shock to you when he was removed from power by his own party?ARCHIE ROACH: Yeah. It was a sad thing to see. He was a Prime Minister of this country who had the guts to apologise to the stolen generations when no other Prime Minister before had the nerve to do that and not long after that took place, you know, he was shafted, you know. And I thought well, you know, that's pretty sad because he's done something at least that has made people - you know, most people can remember, like, what they were doing and where they were on the day of the apology just like when man landed on the moon and so it was a big occasion for Australia when that happened but to see him go was just a sad thing.TONY JONES: What do you think about - we've just seen Maxine McKew who, of course, famously won the seat of Bennelong in 2010 - 2007, I should say, write a book saying that Julia Gillard was a disloyal deputy and I'm just wondering what do you think about that?ARCHIE ROACH: Well, you know, I don't really know. I don't profess to know much about politics at all. But it wasn't just Prime Minister Gillard's ambition and hers alone. There was other people involved, other people in the background, so to speak, behind the scenes. And so, you know, that's all I know about politics and so it was a few people and I think it was, you know, people that were there, you know, doing things, you know.TONY JONES: Well, it goes back to - the reason I raise that because it goes back to the original questioner, who talked about whether self-interest in politics has become more important than the national interest. I'm just wondering whether you can reflect on that.ARCHIE ROACH: Well, I hope not. I would like to think that the national interest involving all Australians was first and foremost in the minds of our politicians or our leaders of this country rather than self-interest.TONY JONES: Let's move to another question from our audience, it's from Caitlin O'Brien.WOMEN &amp; MINORITIES NEED THICK SKINSCAITLIN O'BRIEN: Hi. One of the messages I got out of Julia Gillard's speech and the debate that followed was that women need a thick skin to have success. Do women and people from minorities need to forego parts of their identity to also have success?TONY JONES: So, Kate Lundy, we'll start with you.KATE LUNDY: Look, I do think you need a thick skin. I started off my working life in the building industry and that was a pretty good way to thicken up my skin and I think it served me well as an apprenticeship for politics. But when you choose to be a political person, someone's going to hate you for it or dislike you for it and attack you for it and so you have to make a choice at some point when you're a young political activist or you're approached for pre-selection to stand in Parliament, whether or not that's going to be, you know, a close enough fit with your personality and I think a thick skin really helps and realising that when you're attacked that people are attacking you not because you're you but because of the ideas that you choose to believe in. Everyone has a different strategy of being able to manage the pressure that that brings. But, you know, I've got my own way of dealing with it and I think, well, the Prime Minister has obviously got a very effective way of dealing with it as well and I think one of the most refreshing things about the speech she gave about misogyny was that she, rather than do, I think, what a lot of us do in politics which is, you know, you just bottle it up and wear it or you throw something back if, you know, the opportunity presents itself, but it kind of builds and builds and I think what happened over time with the Prime Minister is everyone around Australia could see that building and see those comments coming in so when she let fly and served one back it was like, yes, and I think it really resonated strongly right around the country.ERIC ABETZ: But she gave that speech in defence of keeping Peter Slipper as the Speaker of the House of Representatives and with the text messages that he sent, I've got to say that is a definition of misogyny if ever you've seen it, and there she was giving this so-called speech of a lifetime in defence of maintaining Peter Slipper as the Speaker. A few hours later he himself came to the conclusion that his position was untenable and resigned, yet here was the Prime Minister trying to defend the indefensible. That's the bizarre thing about all this.KATE LUNDY: Eric, I dont think how many - it doesn't matter how many times you say that, what the Prime Minister said that day was speaking to a lot of women who had seen and observed this behaviour on behalf of a lot of blokes in politics over a long period of time and she really connected, I think, with a lot of people in saying it. No matter how much you want to bring it back to that, it's the only thing the Liberals can say about it. It was a great speech and it spoke to me as well.ERIC ABETZ: Well that's what we were debating.TONY JONES: Okay. Im going to just stop you there because the question was actually about whether women and minorities need to develop a thick skin in this world and particularly in politics. Sekai?SEKAI HOLLAND: No, I don't think myself you have to develop a thick skin. I think when you go into politics, no, for myself, it really was to clean up the image, and by doing so, by example, that politics is a dirty game. It really was to stand for my constituency and to really see that what they were facing as problems was properly addressed and if you have a thick skin I think there are quite a number of things that drop off you. I think that women need to make a decision and I really thought Western women with the struggle s they had in the '60s, would actually carry this into the political, which they haven't, which is why we are still getting the Penny Wongs kicked out and the Prime Minister here facing what she's facing. We need to understand that women's concerns in the Third World, like where I'm from, are different and they really have to be presented and addressed and that while we deal with saying we are mainstreaming, mainstreaming things, we will not address the concerns of the poor, the grass roots and things like that. Anyway, I thought on the issue of the Prime Minister, her story went around the world. I thought what she was saying in the Parliament was we as a parliament, we as a party, cannot make a decision on the Speaker but rather the case was in court and it would be addressed there and I thought that that's what had led to that statement (indistinct)...ERIC ABETZ: What we had...TONY JONES: Okay. Im going to stop you there. This is a debate we've had quite a few times on this show.ERIC ABETZ: What we had...SEKAI HOLLAND: (Indistinct) TONY JONES: Im going to move on. Archie, this question about minorities in Australia having to have thick skins - was also about women and minorities I think the question said. As an indigenous person, did you have to grow up with a thick skin in Australia?ARCHIE ROACH: Yeah, you had to. You know, yeah, I had to grow up with a thick skin. (Indistinct) a lot of things, especially when I was younger and then, you know, people started to talk about my difference, that I was different from the other kids at school and different from people around me and in the workplace even and so, you know, you had to grow up with a pretty thick skin.TONY JONES: Did that hurt? Did it make you change yourself in some way?ARCHIE ROACH: Well it did, it made me more determined, especially in school. It made me more determined to excel and succeed and I think I still hold that true today, yeah.TONY JONES: Before I bring Grahame Morris in on this question we've got a video question for you, Grahame, and its probably related to a few statements you've made in the past. Its from Renee Deleuil in Leederville, Western Australia.KICKING HER TO DEATH COMMENTRENEE DELEUIL: Do you think the recent remark you made about our PM suggesting that people should be out there kicking her to death would have received much more of a media outcry and a police response had it been made by someone from a minority group such as an extremist Muslim leader?TONY JONES: Grahame Morris.GRAHAME MORRIS: Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't quite what I said and I won't repeat what I said because I shouldn't have said it. But on the question of thick skin and thin skin I actually thought the Prime Minister's speech was very good. It was in the wrong climate, the wrong context but her speech standing up for women, I thought, was terrific. The wrong time.TONY JONES: Do you think it was spontaneous or pre-prepared?GRAHAME MORRIS: No, a lot of that was pre-prepared but some of it was just straight from the heart and that's why it worked. She was passion. She was fair dinkum about it and everyone loves that. But, you know, anyone in public life has to have thick skin. You wouldnt believe the sort of criticism that, sort of, I get when I open my mouth and sometimes it's my own stupidity. But youve got to...TONY JONES: Well actually you were quite an early entrant into the misogyny wars, werent you, let's face it? If youd have said the sort of things you said after the Gillard speech do you think you would have gotten away with it as easily as you did?GRAHAME MORRIS: Yeah, thats true. Thats true. Thats true. But I think one has to be very careful here that we don't get all prissy and simply because the Prime Minister is a woman that every time somebody attacks her for being a crumby PM people say, well, that's sexism. No, it's not. Its because in that instance she was a crumby PM and, anyway, apart from that, I think the Prime Minister, compared to John Howard, would get more criticism in a month than Prime Minister Gillard will ever get in her entire career.TONY JONES: Kate Lundy, do you want to respond to that?KATE LUNDY: Look, as I said, I think you build your own sort of - your own way, your own set of defences and your own way of managing, I think, the pressures of the job and I think that my observation about our Prime Minister is I've never seen anybody being so strong and so resilient in the face of very personal criticism. We're not talking about what you're characterising as criticising her for the work she does. It's, more often than not, very personal and I think that everyone has noticed that difference and that's why she got such a great response to her speech to push back on that very personal type of criticism.TONY JONES: Okay. Let's move along. Let's go above the fray to some degree. Youre watching Q&amp;A.; The next question comes from Tendai Jambga. RECONCILIATION IN ZIMBABWETENDAI JAMBGA: Thank you, Tony. Sekai Holland, I grew up in Zimbabwe until the age of 18 when then I moved to Australia to study law and global and international studies. I first want to thank you so much for being a role model to me and so many other young Zimbabweans, but also for being so strong and so passionate and showing what we should actually go do back home. My question to you today is: How successful do you think the reconciliation has been and how much more work still needs to be done?SEKAI HOLLAND: When we finish, you can come and get the global political agreement because when you read the global political agreement you understand that many people don't really understand the process in Zimbabwe. The global political agreement is a peace declaration of the three political parties that one sees in the Parliament and what it really does here is to set out the exact procedures, to set up new institutions, new systems, new regulations, new protocols to prepare for free and fair elections with an eye to defending the vote, the voter, the people who count the vote, the people who announce the vote. Those systems have to be in place so that the free and fair elections give us an outcome which is not contestable. Once you understand that, you know that right now there is no reconciliation process in place because the three senior politicians, myself, the grandmother, and two grandfathers, who were nominated to set up the Organ for national healing, reconciliation and integration, our job was to advise the three principals who are the presidents of three political parties: Robert Gabriel for ZANU-PF; Morgan Richard for MDC-T and, at that time Arthur Guseni Mutambara for MCD. If you understood that our job was to advise the three principals of the GPA on what it would take to set up an infrastructure for peace, then you understand that for the past three years and eight months the three grandparents, us, of politics have been struggling with producing an infrastructure for peace and we have. And you would see also that the constitution-making process, on Monday, came to the process where we are now going to the referendum and you would know that the commissions are in place and you would know that until these things are implemented we are not ready to go for elections. So the processes of JOMIC, COPAC, the Organ, the commissions, are all to prepare for free and fair elections.TORTURE AND TRAUMATONY JONES: So a lot of people find it amazing that you could be sitting across the table from Robert Mugabe so we've got a web question on this subject from Mark Huston in Bellevue Hill, New South Wales: How did you manage to go from the experience of torture and trauma to working with a government who traumatised you?SEKAI HOLLAND: I'm a politician.ERIC ABETZ: Thats very gracious.SEKAI HOLLAND: If you are a politician you don't even ask that.TONY JONES: Of course you're obviously right.SEKAI HOLLAND: Yes.TONY JONES: Except for the fact that you're sitting across from someone whose henchmen tortured you in a very severe way.SEKAI HOLLAND: No, I think that that's also a very Eurocentric way of understanding things. Mugabe is the inheritor...TONY JONES: I thought it was a human way of understanding it.SEKAI HOLLAND: No. Mugabe is inheritor of a system that is a coercive machinery inside that tortures people who do not want to go along with what the mainstream wants. It's there. Smith used it. Edgar Whitehead used it. Before the whites came it was being used also in traditional systems of power. So if you really are a politician in today's world in Africa, you know that independence brought us a very unsatisfactory dispensation where people just walked into the shoes of the colonisers and refined those systems, including the coercive machinery. So if you are a politician...TONY JONES: Can I just remind you of something you said, because I think it might sort of, you know...SEKAI HOLLAND: Okay.TONY JONES: ...bring this to a point. SEKAI HOLLAND: Bring me to it, yes.TONY JONES: You famously said, "Our torture was a victory". SEKAI HOLLAND: Was a - yes.TONY JONES: What does that mean?SEKAI HOLLAND: Because it opened our eyes to realising that for free and fair elections to take place we have to remove the coercive machinery and to do that we had to actually be in a process where Mugabe was part of the problem and where he would become part of the solution in articulating with him what we...TONY JONES: At a human level can you forgive him? Did you forgive him?SEKAI HOLLAND: You know politicians don't talk about trust or forgiveness. It's not there. Its not there. Its not there.TONY JONES: You're saying it's not relevant.SEKAI HOLLAND: Even within our own party, I mean do you trust the next person? No, you don't. But you produce a set of things you agree on, principles that you follow, and I answered very badly the thing on women. I think what women need to do, and I'm realising this too late, what women need to do is to really form their own - it's a very bad word but thats the only word that is there - faction, where their faction is based on their interest, where we cannot be bought off by the men by being given positions up there and then divided. Have our own faction, so we are not going to come in until...TONY JONES: Or just throw it all to the wind and take the actual prime ministership as happened here. SEKAI HOLLAND: No. No. No. No. No.TONY JONES: But listen, I just would like to hear the other panellists on this idea of reconciliation and forgiveness.SEKAI HOLLAND: Okay.TONY JONES: And Archie Roach...SEKAI HOLLAND: No. No. No. I'm just saying to you...TONY JONES: Yeah.SEKAI HOLLAND: ...what we wanted to do...TONY JONES: Okay. All right.SEKAI HOLLAND: ...was set up a process where we would remove the violence so that we really did have free and fair elections. TONY JONES: Okay.SEKAI HOLLAND: That's what we have put the systems in place for only. It has not been implemented yet.TONY JONES: Thanks, Sekai. Archie Roach, on the issues of forgiveness as being part of a reconciliation process, do you think that's important?ARCHIE ROACH: I can only speak for myself really. It has to, you know, as part of healing for all people, not just Indigenous peoples of this country. But it's interesting - I found that very interesting what Sekai had to say just then. But, yeah, it is an important part, especially here in Australia that, you know, that we're able to, you know, forgive otherwise you can't go on. I can't go on, you know, if I didn't find some forgiveness because people only knew, you know - back in the day, people only knew what they knew, you know, and so, you know, I need to find the strength to forgive.TONY JONES: And have you done that, by the way? Have you managed to forgive the individuals and the system, in a way, that took you away from your family?ARCHIE ROACH: Well, you know, it's - yeah, otherwise I couldn't be here today. It's something that wasn't easy but it was something - a process that I worked through through the years and part of my healing, you know, was achieved through that.TONY JONES: Let me ask Eric Abetz is there a lesson here for Australian politics, so bitter, so toxic at the moment, is there a better way? Is there a way you could actually have reconciliation between political groupings in Australia and achieve some sort of joint outcome rather than always be at each other's throats, the thing that drives people crazy?Look, forgiveness and reconciliation are vitally important concepts for political parties and for all of us as individuals and without forgiveness and without reconciliation, families wouldn't be able to operate properly, social interaction would be exceptionally difficult and, if I might say, one of the underlying principles of our society, with its Christian ethic, is forgiveness and reconciliation. Can I say, as a society, we haven't been very good at displaying those values that it is absolutely vital for people to be able to move forward. Just like Archie said, that he was able to find it within himself and that has allowed him to move forward.TONY JONES: It was your leader, Tony Abbott, who referred to wanting to see a kinder, gentler polity in Australia, we haven't seen it. He said that in 2010. We haven't seen anything remotely like that.ERIC ABETZ: Well, can I respectfully disagree with you? You know, when the statement was made to the stolen generation by Kevin Rudd and Brendan Nelson, responded at the time, there have been other occasions when Tony Abbott spoke along with Julia Gillard in relation to these issues. The vast majority of legislation goes through the Parliament unopposed and so let's not beat it up too much. But, having said that, Tony, of course all of us can modify our behaviours and should modify our behaviours. But let's not think that it's all one-way traffic. You know, Tony Abbott was called Jack the Ripper by the Prime Minister but we don't seem to beat that up and demand an apology. TONY JONES: All right. All right. ERIC ABETZ: So let's keep things in context. But look, as a general rule, should we all restrain ourselves and behave better? Of course. But can I say I think that applies to all of us as individuals.TONY JONES: Ill also hear from our other two panellists, Kate Lundy and then Grahame Morris.KATE LUNDY: Well, I think as politicians when you, you know, approach the work we do, we all carry with us a personal responsibility into the Parliament about how we conduct ourselves and I remember years ago when I was first elected, we're talking quite a few years ago now, that I wouldn't interject. I didn't like the look of it when I watched Parliament on television.ERIC ABETZ: So How long ago was that?ERIC ABETZ: Oh, it was a long time ago, Eric. But I remember my grandmother - my first sort of outburst when I did interject across the senate chamber, my grandmother rang me and said that was very unbecoming and it just reminded me that the perception of how we conduct ourselves in Parliament it's so raw and it's not admired but in the heat of the moment you're drawn into it because in that chamber it is passionate debate. We're all there because we believe in something and we believe that we're right so you do get drawn into it. I think there is a line, but each and every one of us as individuals needs to determine where that line is and I like the Gandhi saying where he says, Be the change you want to see, and I try to carry that with me in my job. I'm not always successful.TONY JONES: Just before we bring you in, Grahame, there's a tweet come in from Dream_Brother: Watching Sekai Holland speaking so clearly and eloquently shows how low Australian politicians have fallen.TONY JONES: Grahame Morris?GRAHAME MORRIS: But unlike Zimbabwe, we don't shoot each other. I don't think any of us could ever, ever, ever understand what had happened to Senator Holland or what had happened to Archie, taken away - in Archies case taken away from his mum and Senator Holland being tortured in her own country. We could never, never, never understand that and I was one of those sort of people who believed that one generation could not sort of apologise and say sorry for earlier generations. I sort of didn't really understand how you could do that. I still sort of believe that. But one of Archie's main supporters in Canberra said to me once, and I understood this, they said, "Grahame, how can you expect Archie's generation, when we're talking about reconciliation and recognition in the constitution, how can Archie's generation sit across the table from people and say, look, you don't even recognise what happened to me, what happened to my family, what happened to my brothers and sisters. And until you say sorry we can't move on to the next step." But Archie, can we now?ARCHIE ROACH: Yeah, I believe we can, you know, in the proper way, in the proper manner, with proper consultation with the Indigenous people, yeah.GRAHAME MORRIS: Good.TONY JONES: Grahame, can I ask you a quick question: did you ever make that speech to John Howard?GRAHAME MORRIS: No, because the sorry thing I just did not believe one generation could apologise for things that earlier generations did. But I do understand the point about moving on.SEKAI HOLLAND: Can I just say this to both you on the comment: the reason why, in Zimbabwe, we are putting things on paper, principles and laws and things like that to do with the process of reconciliation, in Australia I think a lot has happened which is really quite brilliant. But I was really shocked today as I was preparing for my speech for the prize, that the constitution of Australia still has not completed what was begun in 1967 and until that is done how do people say forgive, forgive? It has to be done. It has to be done by the Australians.TONY JONES: Let's hear from Archie. What do you think about that, Archie?ARCHIE ROACH: She's correct.SEKAI HOLLAND: By the Australians.ARCHIE ROACH: Shes absolutely right.SEKAI HOLLAND: So forgiveness, you know...TONY JONES: How important would it be to get that recognition?ARCHIE ROACH: You know, when the constitution of Australia was drawn up and written, you know, it never included the Aboriginal people.SEKAI HOLLAND: It still doesn't.ARCHIE ROACH: And we're still not included in the constitution and, you know.SEKAI HOLLAND: Yeah. It has to be done.ARCHIE ROACH: So, you know, she's right, until that is addressed...SEKAI HOLLAND: How do you forgive?ARCHIE ROACH: ...and people look at that, then we truly can't go forward as a people, as a nation, as Australians, as a whole, no.TONY JONES: Kate, should that be addressed as a matter of great urgency?SEKAI HOLLAND: Yes.KATE LUNDY: I think so.SEKAI HOLLAND: Yes. Now. KATE LUNDY: You know, I don't know where the process is up to right now but I know that its something that is being progressed.SEKAI HOLLAND: It has to be done.ERIC ABETZ: You do, you know.TONY JONES: Dont you think that's one of the key points, isnt it? KATE LUNDY: Yeah.SEKAI HOLLAND: Its the key point.TONY JONES: I mean, here you are in the Senate and the Australian Parliament and you don't even know where we're at.KATE LUNDY: Well, I think from hearing from Archie...ERIC ABETZ: Well, Tony, you had the expert panel looking at this and, regrettably, they've come to the conclusion that at this stage they doubt that a referendum would be carried and so what we need to do...TONY JONES: But can you imagine, if we go back to this reconciliation issue and if you had the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister both taking this referendum to the people and saying you must do this, we both agree, both sides of politics agree, would it happen then?ERIC ABETZ: Tony, in the past that has happened and the people have voted no. So what we've got to be very careful in doing is ensuring that any proposition that is put up is carried because the worst possible thing that could happen is that a proposition for indigenous recognition in the constitution is put forward and rejected. That would put the cause back immeasurably...TONY JONES: Can we put this - so youre actually...ERIC ABETZ: ...and that is why...TONY JONES: ...you're actually frightened of the voters?ERIC ABETZ: No. No. No. What we are saying...TONY JONES: Because if you could persuade them...SEKAI HOLLAND: Exactly.TONY JONES: ...which is what politicians are meant to do, on important issues...ERIC ABETZ: And just because, Tony - and just because the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have advocated a particular cause has not seen it be carried at Australian referenda and that has occurred many times. What we need to do is build a broad consensus and the panel, right, wrong or indifferent, have basically reported back and said that at this stage they do not believe that there is that broad consensus.TONY JONES: Okay. I'll just get - just to draw a line under this, I just want to hear from Sekai. Are you surprised? I mean...SEKAI HOLLAND: No. No. So I want to know, doing my speech for the Sydney Peace Prize, what steps are they being taken by the Australian people to have an inclusive society where the first Australians are part of the society totally? One. Two: having heard what it is that is being done, two, why do you talk about forgiveness when you haven't done that? Because I'm saying in Zimbabwe we are really putting ourselves through every possible strenuous exercise to ensure that we have the paperwork in place for an inclusive society and that when that comes through the Parliament Zimbabweans can say we are in an inclusive society and we can have truth, we can have transitional justice and we can have forgiveness. That needs to happen here.TONY JONES: Okay. Im just going to quickly - Grahame, a hard-headed political lobbyist, you've just heard the discussion being batted around. Youve heard that the actual commission doesn't think it's possible to sell this to the Australian people, do you believe that?GRAHAME MORRIS: We need a parliamentary committee where both sides of politics agree but at the moment what is the question? You know, nobody under the age of 55 in this country has ever voted successfully yes for constitutional change. We keep voting no. And even on this one the expert panel came up with about 60 changes to the constitution. Australians would laugh. We need a parliamentary committee to agree on what is the question and then once we can do that we can talk about whether or not we have a referendum outside of an election campaign, which I think would have more chance of success and then I think we need a grass roots movement and I think we also need a whole new generation of young Aboriginal leaders because some of the angry people that we've been listening to for a long time, people have stopped listening to. There's a real chance...TONY JONES: Archie - I'm going to just bring Archie in here. Did you hear that? I mean, do you think that's correct? Do you think that young Aboriginal leaders are too angry?GRAHAME MORRIS: No. No. We need new young ones because some of the ones who have been around for 50 years, people have stopped listening to. We need a whole...TONY JONES: All right. Ill just get Archie, who has been around for quite a long time...SEKAI HOLLAND: What a thing to say.TONY JONES: ...so I'd like to ask him what Archie thinks about that.SEKAI HOLLAND: What a thing to say.ARCHIE ROACH: No, you know, it would be good to find the young people but you need to - you know, I still listen to - I'm a good friend of Pat Dodson, who is a very strong political and he talks a lot of truths. Theres me and a lot of other Aboriginal people, we listen to people like that, Pat. But, yeah, I'd like to see younger people, probably, you know, coming up as well but, you know, I still think we need people like the Pat and Mick Dodsons.TONY JONES: Okay. We've got a questioner down here on floor, if I can just get the microphone to come back down to the floor, we've got the questioner. Sorry about that. You've had your hand up for a while so Ill take your question at the back in the right-hand side there. Go ahead.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Isn't it telling how the two middle aged, white, Anglo, heterosexual men on the panel...TONY JONES: Well, there are actually three of us.AUDIENCE MEMBER: ...are talking about how misogyny is not an election issue. Since Gillard's speech, there's been men out saying that misogyny is not an issue, it's not an issue, remember it's not an issue, and also sitting there talking about reconciliation, presumably you haven't had that issue in your life and to make this into a question, isn't that very telling for the paradigm shift that needs to happen? It could be seen as the people already that have a lot of power just wants to maintain it and Id like to hear Sekais...TONY JONES: I'm going to take that as a comment because we are running out of time. We have got time for one last question. This one is from Zachary Thompson.TALL POPPIESZACHARY THOMPSON: Thanks, Tony. There's been a lot of criticism over James Packer's plans to build a second casino in Sydney. If Australia is a lucky country, why don't we cheer on the Packers and celebrate the prosperity of Australians like them? Why do we ignore tales of success and hard work for narratives of personal greed and exploitation? I don't think that the tall poppy syndrome is an acceptable answer for this question.TONY JONES: Kate Lundy.KATE LUNDY: Well, it's an interesting one and one of the things I think we do need to celebrate far more in Australia are our general successes and I get confronted with this quite a bit in the Industry and Innovation Portfolio where often it's the Australian business people who are the best in their space around the world but here in Australia they have trouble getting (a) recognition for their product or service and particularly, you know, in trying to sell into the domestic market but yet overseas...TONY JONES: This particular question was about James Packer. You actually have two former Labor heavyweights cheering him on, thats for sure, in Karl Bitar and Mark Arbib.KATE LUNDY: Well, youre going straight for the politics. I am actually trying to address the question. TONY JONES: No. No. I mean...KATE LUNDY: And I do think were hard on ourselves and I think that there is still a bit of a cultural cringe about Australian success. We do exceptionally well in a whole range of fields right around the world and often it's Australians that will excel overseas too and I think it is important to recognise success, to celebrate it and acknowledge it when it happens and we don't do it enough in Australian culture.TONY JONES: Grahame Morris.GRAHAME MORRIS: We haven't had a new hotel built in Sydney for more than a decade. This one looks like being pretty flash. They tell me that the gambling casino will be out of bounds for Australians, in other words, it's only people coming into this country, high rollers, so called, but we can all go and stay at the flash hotel. But if I were James Packer I would be saying look, yes, I'd like my hotel and I'd like my gambling sort of area for the high rollers overseas, but to make it easier and more palatable to people I would like to use part of east wing as a sort of Ros Packer named after his mum, Ros Packer theatre for the arts or something because at a moment a lot of people who think Sydney doesn't need another blinking casino, but I think that would soften the blow...TONY JONES: So is it actually right for people to be a little bit dubious about James Packer being given yet another licence to print money?GRAHAME MORRIS: Well, its a fact of life. People are a little big dubious but by geez, hes a bloke whos got so go in him. He wants to put some money into this city but he'll make a buck out of it, what's wrong with that?TONY JONES: Archie Roach, how do you think of James Packer: a great Australian role model or something different?ARCHIE ROACH: You know, I don't really think about him much at all.TONY JONES: What do you think - let's put it this way, what do you think of gambling as a way of making your fortune?ARCHIE ROACH: Gambling, I don't gamble myself. Too many fellows, especially Koories that I know, Aboriginal people, that gamble too much and it's something that's not good. It just becomes another problem for my people, gambling, you know, as well as alcohol and everything else. So, yeah, no, I'm not into gambling. I dont - but those who want to do it, you know, and those who can afford it - to go and lose big amounts of money, good luck to them, you know.TONY JONES: Sekai, it sounds like you will be welcome in the high rollers room if you actually want to go there. What do you think?SEKAI HOLLAND: No, I want to just say to you that I think Australians generally, this Australia that I have come to is really another world to what I came to in 1964 and it's a result of very hard work, of people that actually listen to what they need to do to change their society and Australia has done a lot to get itself to where it is. I really want to acknowledge that. But I would like to just say it is precisely because Australians are such a great people that they need to get this thing with the first Australians right and they can and there's nothing to fear because if they get it right this would be the country for everybody to come and see what can be done by people when they work well together.TONY JONES: A quick final word from Eric Abetz. (Indistinct) the tall poppy issue.ERIC ABETZ: I'm not strong on casinos but, putting that aside, I think we should celebrate Australian success stories and, regrettably, I do think there is, from time to time, the tall poppy syndrome, regrettably, and we should be...SEKAI HOLLAND: Whats a tall poppy?TONY JONES: Ill explain it to you later.ERIC ABETZ: ...celebrating success, encouraging success to ensure that there are more Australians that are successful. I would like to see a lot more people as wealthy as Gina Rinehart and James Packer in Australia.SEKAI HOLLAND: Is not possible.ERIC ABETZ: Wouldn't that be great?SEKAI HOLLAND: Is not possible?ERIC ABETZ: Wouldnt that be great?TONY JONES: I'm afraid that's all we have time for and please thank our panel: Grahame Morris, Kate Lundy, Archie Roach, Sekai Holland, and Eric Abetz. Archie, that's your cue. SEKAI HOLLAND: Whats a tall poppy?ERIC ABETZ: (Indistinct) TONY JONES: Thank you. Next week - excuse me Eric. Well explain what tall poppies are later. Next week Q&amp;A; will be in Perth with the West Australian Premier, Colin Barnett, Labor's former State Minister for Infrastructure Alannah Mactiernan; recently retired Greens leader, Bob Brown, who has been campaigning on environmental issues in WA; Indigenous humans rights lawyer and activist Hannah McGlade; and the editor-in-chief of The West Australian, Bob Cronin. We'll finish tonight with a song by Archie Roach who is joined on the stage by Craig Pilkington. The song is We Won't Cry. Until next week's Q&amp;A;, good night.
